CALIBER is a tool for Frontend-Development.
It helps when developing HTML/CSS from a screenshot and/or provides a flexible SVG grid for better orientation.

Author: Philipp Hennermann, www.cssfly.net/caliber

Usage:

1. Include Caliber.css and Caliber.js in your <head> section.
2. You can now access and configure Caliber by clicking on the "C" button right top on your site.
3. You may alter the SVG to get a GRID for your design or enter a URL of a screenshot.

Notice: Make shure to remove Caliber when going in production mode.
