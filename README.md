CALIBER is a small tool for Frontend-Development.
It helps when developing HTML/CSS from a screenshot-reference and/or provides a flexible SVG grid for better orientation.

Demo: http://www.cssfly.net/caliber/demo/

Usage:

1. Include Caliber.css and Caliber.js in your &lt;head&gt; section.
2. You can now access and configure Caliber by clicking on the "C" button right top on your site.
3. You may alter the SVG to adapt the grid to your design or enter a URL of a screenshot.
4. Configure initial setup of Caliber by passing options (e.g. ScreenShotURL) to the constructor per page.
