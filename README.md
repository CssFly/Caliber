SCREENCALIBER is a small tool for Frontend-Development.
It helps when developing HTML/CSS from a screenshot-reference and/or provides a flexible SVG grid for better orientation. I use ScreenCaliber in combination with Firebug.

Usage:

1. Include ScreenCaliber.css and ScreenCaliber.js in your &lt;head&gt; section.
2. You can now access and configure ScreenCaliber by clicking on the "C" button right top on your site.
3. You may alter the SVG to adapt the grid to your design or enter a URL of a screenshot.
4. Configure initial setup of ScreenCaliber by passing options (e.g. ScreenShotURL) to the constructor per page.
